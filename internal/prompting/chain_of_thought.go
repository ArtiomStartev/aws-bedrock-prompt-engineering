	Problem: A store is having a sale. Sarah buys 3 shirts that normally cost $25 each, but they're 20% off. She also buys 2 pairs of jeans that cost $40 each with no discount. If she pays with a $200 gift card, how much money will she have left on the card?
	
	Let me think through this step by step:
	
	Step 1: Calculate the original cost of the shirts
	3 shirts Ã— $25 each = $75
	
	Step 2: Calculate the discount on the shirts
	20% of $75 = 0.20 Ã— $75 = $15
	
	Step 3: Calculate the discounted price of the shirts
	$75 - $15 = $60
	
	Step 4: Calculate the cost of the jeans
	2 pairs Ã— $40 each = $80
	
	Step 5: Calculate the total purchase amount
	Shirts: $60 + Jeans: $80 = $140
	
	Step 6: Calculate the remaining amount on the gift card
	$200 - $140 = $60
	
	Therefore, Sarah will have $60 left on her gift card.
	
	Now solve this problem using the same step-by-step approach:
	
	Problem: Tom is planning a party for 24 people. Each pizza serves 8 people and costs $12. He also wants to buy drinks that cost $3 per person. If he has a $150 budget, how much money will he have left after buying the food and drinks?

	fmt.Println(strings.Repeat("-", 80))

	Reasoning:
	1. Given: All cats are mammals
	2. Given: All mammals are animals  
	3. Given: Fluffy is a cat
	4. From 1 and 3: Since Fluffy is a cat, and all cats are mammals, Fluffy is a mammal
	5. From 2 and 4: Since Fluffy is a mammal, and all mammals are animals, Fluffy is an animal
	
	Conclusion: Yes, Fluffy is an animal.

// ExecuteCodeDebugging demonstrates chain-of-thought for debugging
func (c *ChainOfThoughtPrompt) ExecuteCodeDebugging() error {

	Example:
	Code with bug:

	        total += num
	    return total / len(numbers)

	Debugging process:
	1. Analyze what the function should do: Calculate the average of a list of numbers
	2. Trace through the code:
	   - Initialize total = 0
	   - Loop through numbers and add to total
	   - Return total divided by length of numbers
	3. Identify the problem: When numbers is empty list [], len(numbers) = 0
	4. Issue: Division by zero will raise ZeroDivisionError
	5. Solution: Add check for empty list
	
	Fixed code:
	def calculate_average(numbers):
	    if not numbers:  # Check if list is empty
	        return 0     # or raise ValueError("Cannot calculate average of empty list")

	Example:
	Decision: Should I accept a job offer in another city?
	
	Analysis framework:
	1. Define the decision criteria
	   - Salary and benefits
	   - Career growth opportunities
	   - Cost of living
	   - Work-life balance
	   - Distance from family/friends
	
	2. Evaluate current situation
	   - Current salary: $70K
	   - Limited growth opportunities
	   - Low cost of living
	   - Close to family
	
	3. Evaluate new opportunity
	   - New salary: $95K (+$25K)
	   - Strong growth potential
	   - Higher cost of living (+$15K/year)
	   - 500 miles from family
	
	4. Calculate net benefits
	   - Financial: +$10K after cost of living
	   - Career: Significant improvement
	   - Personal: Some sacrifice in family time
	
	5. Consider long-term implications
	   - Career trajectory over 5 years
	   - Potential for remote work
	   - Family visit frequency
	
	Conclusion: Accept if career growth is priority and financial gain justifies personal costs.
